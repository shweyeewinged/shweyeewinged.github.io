        <h2>Life and carrer</h2></header>
        <hr>
        <h3>1997–2012: Early life</h3>
        <p>Roseanne Park, Korean name Park Chae-young (박채영), was born on 11 February 1997 in Auckland, New Zealand, to South Korean immigrant parents.She has an older sister named Alice. In 2004, at the age of seven, Rosé and her family moved to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Melbourne">Melbourne</a> , Australia. She began singing and learned to play guitar and piano as a child and performed in church choirs. She attended Kew East Primary School, assumend <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Canterbury Girls' Secondary College">Canterbury Girls' Secondary College</a>  but dropped out before year 11, after signing with South Korean record label YG Entertainment.</p>
        <h3>2012–2015: Pre-debut</h3>
        <p>In 2012, Rosé attended an audition in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sydney">Sydney</a> , Australia for YG Entertainment, whose label's music she already liked,[10] at her father's suggestion. She finished first among the 700 participants. She had initially presumed her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas, and "she didn't think that there was much of a chance to become a K-pop star [herself]." Two months later, she had signed with the label as a trainee, and moved to Seoul, South Korea.
        The same year, Rosé was given an opportunity to feature on labelmate <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=G-Dragon's">G-Dragon's</a> song "Without You" from his extended play (EP) One of a Kind (2012).
